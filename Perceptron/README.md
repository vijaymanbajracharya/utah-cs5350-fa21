file: perceptron.py

-> run all three perceptron algorithms using the run.sh shell script

-> shell script might need to be given permissions to execute using chmod u+x run.sh

-> since the algorithms implement shuffling of training data, the test and train errors might vary between executions

-> the distinct weight vectors and their counts are stored in distinct_weights.txt and is replaced each time the program is run

-> distinct_weights.txt is formatted in this form (weight1, weight2, weight3, weight4, vote count)
